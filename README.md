# Customer Churn Prediction

## About Dataset

### Context
The goal of this project is to predict customer behavior to retain customers. By analyzing relevant customer data, we can develop focused customer retention programs. This dataset is sourced from IBM Sample Data Sets.

### Content
Each row in the dataset represents a customer, and each column contains attributes of the customer described in the column metadata.

The dataset includes information about:

- **Churn**: Customers who left within the last month.

- **Services**: Services that each customer has signed up for including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.

- **Customer Account Information**: How long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.

- **Demographic Info**: Gender, age range, and whether they have partners and dependents.

### Inspiration

This project aims to build predictive models to understand the factors that influence customer churn and to predict the likelihood of churn for individual customers. We will use several machine learning algorithms to achieve this.

###Models and Analysis
In this project, we will use the following machine learning models for predicting customer churn:

- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)**
